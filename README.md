# Dessert Dice
A delicious dice-placement game for two to four players. Dessert Dice can be played in about fifteen minutes and is intended for players who are at least eight years old.

## Components
    - 25 dice
    - 4 cards
    - 1 board

## Set Up
    1. Place the board in the middle of the play area
    2. Deal one card to each player. You may look at your card but you should not show it to anyone else. 
    3. Roll the dice. These dice comprise the *supply*.
    4. Decide who will take the first turn. If you have trouble deciding, then the person who most recently finished all of their vegetables should go first. 

## Gameplay
    During the game, you will take turns manipulating the dice. On your turn you will either place a die from the supply onto the board or move a die from one square on the board to another. After you take your turn, the player to your left should go next. That is, you should take turns in clockwise order. Play continues in this fashion until the supply is empty. 

### Place a Die
To place a die, take any die from the supply and place it in any empty square on the board.
    - You may not change which face of the die is pointed upwards.

### Move a Die
To move a die, tip it into an empty neighboring square on the board. We will say that two squares are *neighbors* if they share an edge. Squares that share only a corner are not neighbors. Note that this action changes both the square in which the die is placed and the face of the die that is pointed upwards.
    - You may not tip a die off the edge of the board.
    - You may not tip a die diagonally.
    - If none of a die's neighboring squares are empty, then you may not move that die on your turn.
    - If the previous player moved a die on their turn, then you may not undo their action by moving that same die back to the square it was in at the start of their turn.

## Scoring
The icon on your card determines which of the dessert icons will be used to compute your score at the end of the game.

To describe how to compute your score, we will use the following terminology:
    - An icon is "displayed" on a die if that icon appears on the face that is pointed upwards.
    - Two dice are *adjacent* to one another if they are in two neighboring squares on the board.
    - A *cluster* of dice is a set of dice on which the same icon is displayed and where die in the set is adjacent to at least one other die in the set. 

Your score is equal to the size of the largest cluster of dice on which your icon is displayed. You win if you have highest score. In the case of a tie, the highest-scoring player who most recently placed a die on their turn wins the game.
